# The Agentic Transformation Framework

## Philosophy

**Think big, start small, improve & adopt.**

AI agents are products, not projects. Success is not a perfect launch—success is going to production with something that works, then improving constantly based on what real data reveals.

---

## Roles

**Business Owner**: Senior leader responsible for a business unit or function. Owns a portfolio of agents. Accountable for ROI. Makes Scale, Fix, or Kill decisions.

**Agent Owner**: Responsible for the success and evolution of an individual agent. Owns improvement and adoption. Reports to the Business Owner.

**Implementation Team**: Builds and maintains the agent technically. Partners with the Agent Owner throughout the lifecycle.

**Business Team**: Domain experts who provide requirements, validate behavior, and test the agent. Works alongside the Agent Owner.

---

## Phase 1: Discovery

Discovery establishes the foundation for transformation through structured exploration and the Agentic Thinking Workshop.

### Entry Point A: High-Level Strategy (Optional)

For organizations that have not yet identified their priority use case.

| Step | Description | Roles Involved |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **1.1 Process Reimagination** | Apply AI-first design thinking. Ask "if we redesigned this process assuming AI capabilities, what would it look like?" | Business Owner, Implementation Team |
| **1.2 High-Level Strategy** | Ensure strategic alignment with organizational priorities. | Business Owner |
| **1.3 High-Level Data Landscape** | Overview of available data sources and their interconnections. | Business Owner, Implementation Team |
| **1.4 Decompose and Prioritize** | Identify buildable increments. Evaluate value versus effort. Select highest-priority use case. | Business Owner |

#### Step 1.1: Process Reimagination

Process Reimagination is the starting point for organizations that haven't yet identified their priority use case. Rather than asking "where can we add an agent?", the Business Owner asks a more powerful question: "If we redesigned this process assuming AI capabilities, what would it look like?"

This shift in perspective is critical. Looking for places to insert AI into existing workflows yields incremental improvements at best. Reimagining processes with AI as a foundational capability surfaces transformational opportunities that would otherwise remain invisible.

The Business Owner leads this exercise, bringing strategic context about which processes matter most to the business unit. The Implementation Team supports by providing perspective on what AI can realistically accomplish—helping distinguish between genuinely high-value opportunities and ideas that sound impressive but lack technical feasibility.

The output of this step is not a list of "AI use cases" but a reimagined view of how work could flow differently. This becomes the raw material for identifying high-value items in subsequent steps.

#### Step 1.2: High-Level Strategy

High-Level Strategy ensures that any AI initiative connects to what actually matters for the business unit. The reimagined processes from Step 1.1 may surface many possibilities, but not all of them align with current organizational priorities.

This step filters opportunities through strategic relevance—ensuring that effort goes toward initiatives that leadership will support and fund. Which opportunities align with the business unit's goals? Which have executive sponsorship? Which fit the current investment appetite?

The Business Owner owns this step entirely. No technical input is required yet. The goal is clarity on strategic direction before resources are committed.

#### Step 1.3: High-Level Data Landscape

Before committing to a use case, the team needs a realistic view of what data exists to support it. This step creates an overview—not a detailed audit—of available data sources and how they interconnect.

The Business Owner brings knowledge of what data the business unit generates and uses. The Implementation Team assesses whether that data is accessible, structured, and likely to support AI capabilities.

Key questions at this stage: What is described in each source? Which use cases could each support? How are sources interconnected? Are there obvious gaps or quality concerns?

This is a feasibility check. A compelling reimagined process means nothing if the data to power it doesn't exist or can't be accessed. Surfacing data constraints early prevents wasted effort on use cases that will stall during implementation.

#### Step 1.4: Decompose and Prioritize

With reimagined processes, strategic alignment, and data landscape understood, the Business Owner now breaks down opportunities into buildable increments and selects where to start.

Decomposition means identifying the smaller pieces within a large opportunity. A fully reimagined process might require multiple agents, integrations, and workflow changes. Breaking it into increments allows the team to deliver value sooner and learn faster.

Prioritization evaluates each increment on value versus effort. Which pieces deliver the most impact for the least investment? Which have data readily available? Which align most closely with immediate business needs?

The output is a selected high-priority use case—the specific opportunity that will move forward into the Discovery Workshop. This decision belongs to the Business Owner, informed by everything learned in Steps 1.1–1.3.

---

### Entry Point B: Known Use Case

For organizations that already know which use case to pursue, skip directly to Step 1.5.

---

| Step | Description | Roles Involved |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **1.5 Focus on High-Priority Use Case** | Confirm the specific use case to pursue. Assign the Agent Owner. | Business Owner, Agent Owner |

#### Step 1.5: Focus on High-Priority Use Case

This step marks the transition from strategic exploration to focused execution. Whether the use case emerged from Steps 1.1–1.4 or was known from the start (Entry Point B), this is where it becomes official.

The Business Owner confirms the specific use case to pursue. Equally important, this is when the Agent Owner is assigned. The Agent Owner will take responsibility for this agent's success through development, testing, improvement, and adoption.

The assignment is formal. The Agent Owner needs clear mandate and accountability from this point forward. The Business Owner remains involved but shifts from driving to overseeing.

From here, the Discovery Workshop begins.

---

### Discovery Workshop: Agentic Thinking

The workshop translates the chosen use case into actionable foundations for development.

| Step | Description | Roles Involved |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **1.6 Process Mapping** | Map current process for the specific use case. Draft the "Process Reimagined" state. | Agent Owner, Business Team, Implementation Team |
| **1.7 User Value Proposition** | Define how the agent will support end users. Articulate why they will return to use it repeatedly. | Agent Owner, Business Team |
| **1.8 Capability Mapping** | Define capability statements: "This agent should be capable of..." Prioritize must-haves. | Agent Owner, Business Team, Business Owner |
| **1.9 Guardrails Exploration** | Define boundaries, safety requirements, compliance constraints, and escalation paths. | Agent Owner, Business Team, Implementation Team |
| **1.10 High-Level Data Mapping** | Identify relevant data sources. Initial structure review. Basic availability check. | Agent Owner, Implementation Team |

#### Step 1.6: Process Mapping

Process Mapping is the first step of the Discovery Workshop. The Agent Owner leads the team in documenting the current process for the specific use case selected in Step 1.5.

This is detailed work. The team maps how work actually flows today—not the idealized version, but reality. Where does work originate? What steps does it pass through? Where do delays occur? Where is human judgment most heavily applied?

With the current state documented, the team drafts the "Process Reimagined" state. This is the target: how the process would work with an agent in place. What steps does the agent handle? Where does human oversight remain? How does the workflow change?

The gap between current and reimagined states defines what the agent must accomplish.

#### Step 1.7: User Value Proposition

User Value Proposition defines why users will actually use this agent. Without a clear answer to this question, even a technically excellent agent will fail to gain adoption.

The Agent Owner leads the team in articulating how the agent will support end users. What problem does it solve for them? What friction does it remove? What capability does it provide that they don't have today?

Equally important: Why will users come back to use it repeatedly? A one-time novelty isn't valuable. The agent must deliver ongoing value that makes it part of users' regular workflow.

This step connects directly to adoption. The higher the genuine value to users, the higher the adoption. The higher the adoption, the higher the ROI. A weak value proposition identified now can be strengthened before development begins.

#### Step 1.8: Capability Mapping

Capability Mapping translates the reimagined process into specific agent capabilities. The team creates a list of capability statements, each framed as: "This agent should be capable of..."

The Business Team provides domain expertise on what capabilities would genuinely help users. The Agent Owner facilitates and documents. The Business Owner provides input on which capabilities matter most for ROI—ensuring the team doesn't build impressive features that don't drive value.

Not all capabilities are equal. The team prioritizes must-haves versus nice-to-haves. Must-haves are essential for the agent to deliver its core value proposition. Nice-to-haves can wait for future iterations.

This prioritization is crucial. Scope creep kills AI projects. A focused agent that does a few things well will succeed where an ambitious agent that tries to do everything will fail.

#### Step 1.9: Guardrails Exploration

Guardrails define what the agent should not do. This step establishes boundaries, safety requirements, compliance constraints, and escalation paths.

The Business Team identifies situations where the agent must defer to humans. Sensitive decisions, edge cases, and high-risk scenarios need clear escalation paths. The Implementation Team advises on what's technically feasible to enforce.

Compliance constraints come from regulatory requirements, company policies, or industry standards. These are non-negotiable boundaries the agent must respect.

Safety requirements address potential harms. What could go wrong if the agent behaves unexpectedly? How can those risks be mitigated?

Guardrails aren't limitations on value—they're prerequisites for trust. An agent without clear boundaries won't be adopted because users won't trust it. Defining guardrails early ensures they're built in, not bolted on.

#### Step 1.10: High-Level Data Mapping

High-Level Data Mapping focuses on the specific data sources required for the selected use case. Unlike the broad overview in Step 1.3, this step identifies exactly which data the agent will need to access.

The Agent Owner and Implementation Team review each capability from Step 1.8 and map it to data requirements. What data does the agent need to perform this capability? Where does that data live? What format is it in?

Initial structure review examines whether the data is organized in ways the agent can use. A basic availability check confirms the data can actually be accessed—permissions, APIs, and integrations may all be factors.

This step surfaces data gaps early. If a critical capability requires data that doesn't exist or can't be accessed, the team learns now rather than during development.

---

## Parallel Exploration

Six workstreams run in parallel following the Discovery Workshop.

| Workstream | Description | Roles Involved |
|------------|-------------|----------------|
| **ROI** | Define success metrics, baselines, targets, and ROI calculation methodology. | Agent Owner, Business Owner |
| **Adoption** | Identify user personas, surface adoption barriers, define success indicators. | Agent Owner, Business Team |
| **Data** | Deep dive into specific data sources. Assess quality. Begin RAG experimentation. | Agent Owner, Implementation Team |
| **Rollout Strategy and Roadmap** | Define first users, starting location, staged rollout strategy. | Agent Owner, Business Team, Business Owner |
| **Evaluation** | Define evaluation criteria, quality metrics, testing approach. | Agent Owner, Implementation Team |
| **Agent Owner** | Formalize assignment, define responsibilities, establish ownership expectations. | Agent Owner, Business Owner |

#### ROI Workstream

The Agent Owner and Business Owner work together to define success metrics—the specific measurements that will indicate whether the agent is delivering value. Baselines capture the current state. Targets define what success looks like. The team agrees on ROI calculation methodology to prevent disputes later about whether the agent is actually working.

#### Adoption Workstream

Identify user personas—the different types of people who will interact with the agent. Surface adoption barriers: skepticism about AI, competing priorities, fear of job displacement. Define success indicators: active users, frequency of use, task completion rates. This workstream ensures the team thinks about adoption before launch.

#### Data Workstream

Deep dive into each specific data source required for the agent's capabilities. Assess data quality: inconsistencies, gaps, outdated records, formatting problems. For agents using unstructured data, RAG experimentation begins. This workstream ensures the data foundation is solid before building begins.

#### Roll Out Strategy Workstream

Define first users—the initial group who will use the agent. These should be carefully selected: supportive enough to provide constructive feedback, representative enough to surface real issues. Plan the staged rollout strategy from first users to full deployment.

**Control vs Autonomy:** View the rollout through the lens of control versus autonomy. Initially, always start with a controlled rollout where the agent has limited autonomy to make decisions. As trust builds and the agent proves reliable, gradually cede control and move toward a more autonomous agent.

**Risk-Based Progression:** Also view the rollout through the lens of risk. Initially, the agent should handle low-risk items only. As the agent earns trust through consistent performance, gradually expand its scope to include higher-risk items.

#### Evaluation Workstream

Establish evaluation criteria defining what "good" looks like. Quality metrics translate criteria into measurable indicators for the feedback loop in Phase 4. Design the testing approach: which test cases matter most, how to cover edge cases, how to detect regression.

#### Human in the Loop Workstream

Define when and how humans intervene in the agent's operations. Not all decisions should be fully automated—this workstream establishes the boundaries.

**Approval-Based Intervention:** Some actions require human approval before the agent proceeds. What decisions need sign-off? Who has authority to approve? What's the turnaround expectation? This is common for high-stakes or irreversible actions.

**Escalation-Based Intervention:** The agent handles routine cases but escalates when it encounters uncertainty, edge cases, or situations outside its training. Define escalation triggers: confidence thresholds, specific keywords, unusual patterns, or explicit user requests.

**Topic-Based Handoff:** Certain topics transfer control entirely to a human. The agent recognizes it cannot or should not handle the situation and hands off completely. What topics require full handoff? Legal advice? Complaints? Sensitive personal matters?

**Identifying the Human(s):** Who will the human be? This could be a single designated person, a rotating team, specialists for different domains, or a tiered structure where simple escalations go to one group and complex ones to another. Consider availability, expertise, and response time requirements.

**Multiple Humans:** Some scenarios may require multiple humans—one for technical review, another for business approval, or a committee for significant decisions. Define the workflow: sequential or parallel? Who has final authority?

#### Agent Owner Workstream

Formalize the Agent Owner's role for this specific agent. Define responsibilities in detail: what they're accountable for, what decisions they can make autonomously, what requires Business Owner approval. Establish ownership expectations for the entire lifecycle.

---

## Phase 2: Development

Development translates discovery outputs into a working agent.

| Step | Description | Roles Involved |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **2.1 First Draft Creation** | Build the first draft based on Discovery Workshop outcomes and Parallel Exploration inputs. | Implementation Team, Agent Owner |
| **2.2 Validation and Iteration** | Test the draft. Multiple refinement cycles shape the agent toward intended behavior. | Agent Owner, Business Team, Implementation Team |

#### Step 2.1: First Draft Creation

First Draft Creation is where the agent begins to exist. The Implementation Team builds the first working version based on everything learned in Discovery and Parallel Exploration.

The Discovery Workshop outcomes—process mapping, capability mapping, guardrails, and data mapping—provide the blueprint. Parallel Exploration inputs refine the approach with ROI targets, deployment plans, and evaluation criteria.

This is not the final agent. It's a first draft—functional enough to test, incomplete enough to require iteration. The goal is to create something concrete that the team can react to and refine.

The Agent Owner coordinates closely with the Implementation Team, ensuring the build stays aligned with business intent while remaining technically feasible.

#### Step 2.2: Validation and Iteration

Validation and Iteration is where the first draft becomes a working agent through cycles of testing and refinement.

The Business Team tests the draft against real scenarios. Does the agent handle the expected cases? How does it respond to edge cases? Where does it fall short?

Multiple refinement cycles shape the agent toward intended behavior. Each cycle surfaces issues, the Implementation Team addresses them, and the next round of testing reveals what's improved and what remains.

The Agent Owner orchestrates this process, prioritizing which issues to address and ensuring cycles move efficiently. Not every issue needs to be fixed before moving forward—the goal is an agent good enough for testing with real users.

This step may take multiple iterations. Rushing through it creates problems that are harder to fix after launch.

---

## Phase 3: Testing and Route to Production

Testing happens in three waves.

| Step | Description | Roles Involved |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **3.1 Initial Testing** | Small, focused group tests for fast feedback and rapid iteration. | Agent Owner, Implementation Team |
| **3.2 Broader Testing** | Expand to cover different roles and personas. Discover actual needs versus assumptions. | Agent Owner, Business Team |
| **3.3 Production Launch** | Launch when core functionalities are satisfactory. Early launch expected—real data drives improvement. | Agent Owner, Business Owner (go/no-go) |

#### Step 3.1: Initial Testing

Initial Testing puts the agent in front of real users for the first time—but in a controlled way.

A small, focused group tests the agent. These are typically the "first users" identified in the Roll Out Strategy Workstream: supportive, representative, and willing to provide candid feedback.

The goal is fast feedback and rapid iteration. Issues discovered here are fixed quickly while the user base is small. The agent's personality, tone, and behavior are fine-tuned based on how real users actually interact with it.

The Agent Owner gathers feedback systematically and works with the Implementation Team to address issues. Speed matters—this phase should move quickly to maintain momentum and tester engagement.

#### Step 3.2: Broader Testing

Broader Testing expands the user base to cover different roles and personas identified during Parallel Exploration.

This phase reveals what people really want versus what was assumed. Different user types interact with the agent differently. Some find it intuitive; others struggle. Some use it for expected purposes; others discover unexpected applications.

The Agent Owner and Business Team work together to understand these patterns. What works? What doesn't? Where are the gaps between design assumptions and actual needs?

Findings from this phase inform final refinements before production. Some issues may require fixes; others may become known limitations to address post-launch.

#### Step 3.3: Production Launch

Production Launch is when the agent becomes real. It moves from testing to actual use by the intended user base.

Launch happens when core functionalities are satisfactory. This doesn't mean perfect—early launch is expected and encouraged. An agent that works well enough to generate real data will improve faster than an agent stuck in endless testing.

The Business Owner makes the go/no-go decision. This is a gate: Does the agent meet the minimum criteria established in the Evaluation Workstream? Is it ready for production?

Once launched, the agent enters the continuous loop of Improvement and Adoption. Real data drives improvement. The Agent Owner's focus shifts from building to evolving.

---

## Phase 4: Improvement

Improvement is ongoing—the agent gets better based on real-world performance.

| Step | Description | Roles Involved |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **4.1 Feedback Loop** | Collect implicit feedback (evaluations, usage patterns) and explicit feedback (direct user input). | Agent Owner |
| **4.2 Detect and Address Gaps** | Clean data inconsistencies. Fill knowledge gaps. Adjust behavior for edge cases. | Agent Owner, Implementation Team |
| **4.3 Communicate Improvements** | Notify users when fixes are applied. Close the feedback loop to build trust. | Agent Owner |

#### Step 4.1: Feedback Loop

The Feedback Loop is the engine of continuous improvement. The Agent Owner collects both types of feedback that reveal how the agent is performing.

Implicit feedback comes from evaluations and usage patterns. Low evaluation scores indicate quality problems. Usage patterns reveal what users actually do—where they succeed, where they drop off, what they ignore.

Explicit feedback comes directly from users. Comments, ratings, complaints, and requests all provide insight into user experience and unmet needs.

Both types of feedback are essential. Implicit feedback catches issues users don't bother to report. Explicit feedback captures context and nuance that metrics miss.

The Agent Owner monitors this feedback continuously, looking for patterns that indicate where the agent needs improvement.

#### Step 4.2: Detect and Address Gaps

Detect and Address Gaps is where feedback becomes action. The Agent Owner identifies specific issues and works with the Implementation Team to resolve them.

Data inconsistencies are common early on. The agent may encounter conflicting information, outdated records, or formatting problems that cause incorrect responses. Cleaning this data improves performance.

Knowledge gaps appear when users ask questions the agent can't answer. Filling these gaps—adding documents, expanding instructions, improving retrieval—extends the agent's capabilities.

Edge cases emerge as more users interact with the agent. Behavior that worked in testing may fail in unexpected real-world scenarios. Adjusting agent behavior for these cases improves reliability.

This is ongoing work, not a one-time effort. The agent continuously improves based on what real usage reveals.

#### Step 4.3: Communicate Improvements

Communicate Improvements closes the feedback loop with users. When fixes are applied, users should know.

Notification matters because it builds trust. Users who reported problems see that their feedback led to action. Users who encountered issues learn that those issues are resolved.

This communication doesn't need to be elaborate. A simple notification that a previously unanswerable question now has an answer, or that a known bug is fixed, is enough.

The Agent Owner owns this communication. It's not just about informing users—it's about demonstrating that the agent is actively maintained and improving. This visibility encourages continued engagement and additional feedback.

---

## Phase 5: Adoption

Adoption runs in parallel with improvement—they feed each other continuously.

| Step | Description | Roles Involved |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **5.1 Understand User Base** | Adapt strategy based on real user behavior. Close gap between assumed and actual needs. | Agent Owner |
| **5.2 Address Adoption Barriers** | Systematically work through barriers: skeptical managers, competing priorities, resistance patterns, and organizational dynamics. Escalate blockers that require Business Owner intervention. | Agent Owner, Business Owner (when escalated) |
| **5.3 Promote the Agent** | Showcase capabilities. Identify power users as they emerge. | Agent Owner |
| **5.4 Champion Network** | Cultivate early adopters into internal advocates who support teammates. | Agent Owner |
| **5.5 Expand Capabilities** | Identify multi-agent opportunities. Formalize patterns users discover. | Agent Owner, Business Owner (scale decision) |

#### Step 5.1: Understand User Base

Understand User Base is about closing the gap between assumptions and reality. What users actually do with the agent often differs from what was expected.

The Agent Owner adapts strategy based on real user behavior. Which personas use the agent most? Which ignore it? What do heavy users do differently from light users?

This understanding informs every other adoption activity. Promotion efforts can target underutilizing segments. Champion recruitment can focus on where momentum already exists. Barrier removal can prioritize what actually blocks people.

Adoption strategy should evolve continuously based on what the data reveals about how users actually engage with the agent.

#### Step 5.2: Address Adoption Barriers

Address Adoption Barriers is systematic work to remove what prevents users from adopting the agent.

Skeptical managers may block their teams from using the agent. The Agent Owner addresses this through evidence, demonstration, and relationship-building.

Competing priorities mean users feel "too busy" for adoption. The Agent Owner reframes the agent as helping with priorities rather than competing with them.

Resistance patterns emerge from various sources—fear of change, distrust of AI, past negative experiences. Each pattern needs a tailored response.

Organizational dynamics may create blockers the Agent Owner can't resolve alone. When barriers require authority or resources beyond the Agent Owner's reach, escalation to the Business Owner is appropriate.

This step acknowledges that adoption is often blocked by people problems, not product problems.

#### Step 5.3: Promote the Agent

Promote the Agent is about making value visible. Users who don't know what the agent can do won't use it.

Showcasing capabilities means demonstrating what's possible. Real examples, success stories, and use cases help potential users understand how the agent could help them.

Power users emerge naturally as some users engage more deeply than others. The Agent Owner identifies these power users and engages with them—understanding their needs, helping them do more, and learning from their usage patterns.

Promotion isn't marketing. It's helping users understand the art of the possible so they can make informed decisions about whether to engage.

#### Step 5.4: Champion Network

Champion Network multiplies the Agent Owner's impact. Early adopters who believe in the agent become internal advocates.

Cultivating champions means identifying users who are both enthusiastic and influential. These individuals promote usage within their teams, answer questions from peers, and provide social proof that the agent works.

Champions support teammates in ways the Agent Owner cannot. They're present in meetings, available for quick questions, and trusted by their colleagues. Their endorsement carries weight that official communications don't.

The Agent Owner supports champions with information, recognition, and access. A healthy champion network scales adoption beyond what the Agent Owner could achieve alone.

#### Step 5.5: Expand Capabilities

Expand Capabilities is about growth—both in what the agent can do and in how widely it's used.

As the agent matures, opportunities emerge for capability expansion. Users request new features. Adjacent use cases become visible. Multi-agent opportunities surface where agents could work together.

The Agent Owner identifies these opportunities and presents them to the Business Owner for scale decisions. Which expansions justify investment? Which align with strategic priorities?

This step also formalizes patterns users discover. When users find creative applications for the agent, those patterns can become supported capabilities rather than workarounds.

---

## The Continuous Loop

Improvement and Adoption form a continuous cycle:

- **Improvement drives adoption**: Better agents attract more users
- **Adoption generates feedback**: More users reveal more gaps
- **Feedback drives improvement**: Gaps become addressable

---

## Business Owner: Ongoing Oversight

Throughout all phases, the Business Owner maintains oversight through five essentials:

| # | Essential | Description |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | **Agent Owner Visibility** | Know who owns what and whether they're hitting targets |
| 2 | **Communication Channel** | Direct line to Agent Owner without scheduling meetings |
| 3 | **ROI Visibility** | Clear view of value delivered vs. investment |
| 4 | **Red Flag Alerts** | Automatic cues when something is underperforming |
| 5 | **Portfolio Decisions** | Framework to Scale, Fix, or Kill with confidence |

The Business Owner is actively involved in:
- Discovery Phase (driving use case selection)
- Capability Mapping (input on what matters for ROI)
- ROI Workstream (agreeing on calculation methodology)
- Production Launch (go/no-go decision)
- Expand Capabilities (scale decisions)

Otherwise, the Agent Owner operates with autonomy, and the Business Owner monitors via alerts and dashboards.
