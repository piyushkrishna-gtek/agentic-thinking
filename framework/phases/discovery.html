                        <p>Process Reimagination is the starting point for organizations that haven't yet identified their priority use case. Rather than asking "where can we add an agent?", the Business Owner asks a more powerful question: "If we redesigned this process assuming AI capabilities, what would it look like?"</p>
                        <p>This shift in perspective is critical. Looking for places to insert AI into existing workflows yields incremental improvements at best. Reimagining processes with AI as a foundational capability surfaces transformational opportunities that would otherwise remain invisible.</p>
                        <p>The Business Owner leads this exercise, bringing strategic context about which processes matter most to the business unit. The Implementation Team supports by providing perspective on what AI can realistically accomplish—helping distinguish between genuinely high-value opportunities and ideas that sound impressive but lack technical feasibility.</p>
                        <p>The output of this step is not a list of "AI use cases" but a reimagined view of how work could flow differently. This becomes the raw material for identifying high-value items in subsequent steps.</p>

                        <p>This step filters opportunities through strategic relevance—ensuring that effort goes toward initiatives that leadership will support and fund. Which opportunities align with the business unit's goals? Which have executive sponsorship? Which fit the current investment appetite?</p>
                        <p>The Business Owner owns this step entirely. No technical input is required yet. The goal is clarity on strategic direction before resources are committed.</p>

                        <p>Before committing to a use case, the team needs a realistic view of what data exists to support it. This step creates an overview—not a detailed audit—of available data sources and how they interconnect.</p>
                        <p>The Business Owner brings knowledge of what data the business unit generates and uses. The Implementation Team assesses whether that data is accessible, structured, and likely to support AI capabilities.</p>
                        <p>Key questions at this stage: What is described in each source? Which use cases could each support? How are sources interconnected? Are there obvious gaps or quality concerns?</p>
                        <p>This is a feasibility check. A compelling reimagined process means nothing if the data to power it doesn't exist or can't be accessed. Surfacing data constraints early prevents wasted effort on use cases that will stall during implementation.</p>

                        <p>Decomposition means identifying the smaller pieces within a large opportunity. A fully reimagined process might require multiple agents, integrations, and workflow changes. Breaking it into increments allows the team to deliver value sooner and learn faster.</p>
                        <p>Prioritization evaluates each increment on value versus effort. Which pieces deliver the most impact for the least investment? Which have data readily available? Which align most closely with immediate business needs?</p>

                        <p>User Value Proposition defines why users will actually use this agent. Without a clear answer to this question, even a technically excellent agent will fail to gain adoption.</p>

                        <p>The Business Team provides domain expertise on what capabilities would genuinely help users. The Agent Owner facilitates and documents. The Business Owner provides input on which capabilities matter most for ROI—ensuring the team doesn't build impressive features that don't drive value.</p>
                        <p>Not all capabilities are equal. The team prioritizes must-haves versus nice-to-haves. Must-haves are essential for the agent to deliver its core value proposition. Nice-to-haves can wait for future iterations.</p>
                        <p>This prioritization is crucial. Scope creep kills AI projects. A focused agent that does a few things well will succeed where an ambitious agent that tries to do everything will fail.</p>

                        <p>Compliance constraints come from regulatory requirements, company policies, or industry standards. These are non-negotiable boundaries the agent must respect.</p>

                        <p>The Agent Owner and Implementation Team review each capability from Step 1.8 and map it to data requirements. What data does the agent need to perform this capability? Where does that data live? What format is it in?</p>
                        <p>Initial structure review examines whether the data is organized in ways the agent can use. A basic availability check confirms the data can actually be accessed—permissions, APIs, and integrations may all be factors.</p>
